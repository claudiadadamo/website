So many months after I started this project I feel the need to finish it - it's been very busy these past few months with work, events, the holidaysâ€¦ With the new year I feel inspired to build some cool stuff and learn some new skills.

I want to get through these last posts both for closure and for a new beginning - This has been a great goal for the last part of 2014, and although I haven't been able to keep up with the 30 day limit I originally made, I will have made 30 posts that I would not have written in the first place. I pushed myself in the fall to do as much as possible, and I feel  much more comfortable, confident in my skills, and energized to keep learning in my free time (although recently I haven't had much of it!)

So, I wanted to write my few New Years resolutions that I have come up with so far. I'll probably make more as the year goes on but it's a start:

*Read more books*

- So far this year, I've been doing this well! i'm currently reading the Cuckoo's Calling by Robert Galbraith (JK Rowling's Pseudonym) which I really like, although in hardcover it's hard to carry around. On the train I've been reading Beautiful Ruins, which reminds me of Italy and sparks my itch to travel more.

*Work on new projects*

- Knitting, crocheting, more hardware, coding projects. I feel inspired to really find my passions (I have so many already) so I want to experiment more. I would like this year to try a glass blowing class, and possibly a silver smithing class.

*Be more up to date on current events*

*Eat better and become better at cooking*

*Write down my dreams*

- I've started this already as well, and it has been very interesting. Most times I can only remember a few parts of my dreams but even writing those down has been eye opening.

*Get my GitHub streak up!*	

- Perhaps this year I'll start another personal challenge for myself - I think that this 30 day challenge has really helped me understand how I work, and how I would change something like it if I did it again.
