I made the cutest apple pies - I (still) have applies left over from apple picking, and I had bought some pie crust recently that I wanted to use up. I didn't feel like baking a full pie because it's hard to share at work and requires a lot of time, so I decided to try out this recipe I found online: [http://www.freutcake.com/in-the-kitchen/mini-caramel-apple-hand-pies/](http://www.freutcake.com/in-the-kitchen/mini-caramel-apple-hand-pies/).

They turned out really well! I just didn't add the caramel in because I don't have any but the proportion of spices to apples to crust worked well. They were a hit at work!

I may try to make my own pie crust next time, but for this the Pillsbury ready made pie crusts worked well.
