title: Another Set of Thank You Notes
date: 2013-05-22

On Saturday, I graduated from Wheaton College in Massachusetts. I can't believe it's over! I wanted to write thank you notes for my professors, advisors and friends, and I wanted to make them really personalized. So, I took some nice paper that I had (some of it seen in my papercraft Maker Corps box project) and designed a few thank you cards to show and tell them how much I appreciate their support throughout these years.

I haven't written them yet (unpacking is taking forever), but they'll be sent out soon.
