title: iOS App - The Blood Type Diet

For my senior seminar project, I chose to create an iOS app. I created an app similar to the existing app that my parents have for their company. I wanted to try to do a redesign to see what I could do, and I also had never written anything in Objective-C before, so learning that syntax was another goal.

Another part of our project was to create a website to show all of our work. I wanted to create a fully designed site to organize my work, and also help me learn some more HTML/CSS. I've uploaded my website so you can see it [here](http://www.claudiadadamo.com/SeniorProject/semproject.html).

I wanted to go through the entire design process for the app, including sketching, wireframing and prototyping, and actually creating the interface. I used Python to write a script to parse Excel files that my parents sent me of their data, which was then saved into plist files for access within the app. The entire script is viewable [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fkosmcydhvq5spq/getTypeData.py).

Another large goal I had was to change the colors of the navigation bars based on what the user selected. I had them almost working by the end of the semester, so I'd like to finish that up this summer. I think my proudest moment was when I figured out how to edit strings to be able to access images from the internet instead of having them inside the app!
