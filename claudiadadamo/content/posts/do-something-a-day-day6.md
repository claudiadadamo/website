Today was exhausting, so I'm just going to write about the hat that I made a few weeks ago since I don't have the time or energy to work on anything tonight but I want to keep up my blog posts about projects!

A few weekends ago, I decided I wanted to try knitting a hat from a pattern start to finish. After looking around on Ravelry and Google, I came across this [pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bulky-waffle-hat).

I used 100% Merino Superwash 128 from Cascade Yarns, color 896 to knit the hat. The yarn is super soft, and I used less than one skein which was really surprising but perfect since I only had one. The pattern is really easy to follow, and the hat came out really nicely. I followed it for a medium adult, but I think I should have gone through and added one more set of four rows to make it a bit longer. It fits well though, although it's not a slouchy beanie.

I really recommend this pattern for anyone looking for a quick, easy hat to make. It only took a few hours and one skein. This yarn was also a perfect fit, and I used size 10 circular needles which worked well.
