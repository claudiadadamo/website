title: Initial Design for Hard Drive Shelving Unit
date: 2013-01-20

I designed a shelving unit for external hard drives, initially which could hold 4 separate hard drives in one unit. The designs were created to be printed on our lab's Makerbot Replicator, but the conversion from SketchUp files to the Makerbot hasn't worked perfectly yet. More prints and edits will hopefully fix it and it should be doable.

Then I decided to create a stackable shelf to print as many shelves as desired and stack on top of each other.
