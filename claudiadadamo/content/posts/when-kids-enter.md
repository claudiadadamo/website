> When kids enter a makerspace in a school, their frame of reference should shift from finding the right answer to asking the right question.


I just read the post, "3 Key Qualities for a School Makerspace" on the Make blog by Parker Thomas, and I really loved it.

I think it's very true; makerspaces shouldn't push outcomes on students - they should be a place to explore and ask questions and not feel pressure to perform or do something the 'right way.'
