Our second assignment for Maker Corps was to "make stuff" so I decided to do some paper craft with really nice looking paper I had bought a while ago.

I thought it would be cool to make a bunch of boxes, each a bit smaller than the other so that they fit inside each other.

After I started building the boxes I had the idea to try out some bookbinding, so I sewed the spine of a few pages of paper together, and it ended up pretty well!
