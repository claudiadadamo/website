Today I found a project that I had started last winter/spring, but never finished. I was working on a black circle scarf that I finished today.


I used Cascade Yarns Magnum yarn in black in a seed stitch pattern. This pattern is really easy, just cast on an even number of stitches, repeat K1 P1 for one row, then P1 K1 for the next and so forth.

I did this until I had a good length for a long scarf, and then joined both sides together at the end.

I'm so excited to wear this for the fall!
