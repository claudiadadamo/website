Today I went apple picking with some coworkers at Honey Pot Hill Orchards in Stow, MA. After 4 rainy days, today was the perfect weather for being outside picking some delicious apples!

After picking (and taste testing) a bunch of Cortland, Macoun, Macintosh, and Mutsu, our bags were full! It was a gorgeous sunny fall day, so we put our bags in the car and went down to the farm store to get apple cider donuts. The line was ridiculously long, so we waited I think about an hour for the donuts in total. They were really good, so I'm glad we did that!

This orchard is so cute. It's pretty, the apples are delicious, the donuts are great and there are hayrides and animals and anything fall-related you could ask for. This was the perfect activity for getting excited about the fall!

Now, what to make with all of the applesâ€¦
