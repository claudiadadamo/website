I don't have too much to talk about tonight, other than that I played on my keyboard. I have a Yamaha YPT 230 which I love and now that I live in an apartment with better storage I can actually keep it with me! My friend Rachel and I jammed before she left, and tonight I wanted to play.

After hearing Aphex Twin's new album (specifically his new song aisatsana) I got the strong urge to play the keyboard. When I got home tonight I heard someone playing piano through my closet (thin walls!) but it was beautiful and inspiring.

Here's what Rachel and I recorded when we played together:
