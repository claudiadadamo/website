Today I had the pleasure of going to the [Franklin Mill Store](http://www.franklinmillstore.com)Â in Franklin, MA. The store is huge, and they have the most amazing selection of fabrics, yarns and tools.

I had no idea they had that much yarn! There were walls of really nice wools, cottons and even a merino/silk/cashmere blend. I bought it.. it's SO soft!

I ended up buying much more yarn than I expected... Definitely worth it!

I had the idea when we got back to create an Evernote notebook for the different yarns that I have (maybe I'll do one for fabrics) - it allows me to keep track of the different yarns that I have, so I can remember where I got them and what types they are. You can check it out here if you're interested:

I'm going to try to add to it as much as I can! I have some other yarns in my room that I'll add. I hope that I can keep buying nice yarn like they had at the Franklin Mill Store.

I loved this store - I'm definitely going to try to head back before I graduate. I'm going to work on sewing and try to teach myself again. I used to sew in Montessori but I haven't in years! My mom also told me we have an old sewing machine at home she may be able to give me! So exciting. As of right now I'm going to try to create a bag like the one I had in school to hold my needles and yarn.
