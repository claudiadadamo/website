Tonight I wanted to make something with the apples that I picked yesterday. I wanted to save making apple pie for another night, so I found a recipe for Apple Pie Crumble Bars online. You can find the original recipe [here](http://www.bakedbyrachel.com/apple-pie-crumble-bars-recipe/).

There were 3 separate parts to this recipe - the crust on the bottom, the apple filling and the crumble on top. The crust needed to bake for a while before, and it got a little bit overdone because of my electric oven and I forgot to peel the apples, but the bars turned out well. 

While the crust was baking I made the filling, which was just cooking apple slices with butter, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Then the crumble on top is made of oats, flour, and a few other things..

Overall these turned out really well. Looking at the pictures mine don't look exactly the same, but they're tasty. I think next time I'll use more apples, peel them, and try to perfect the timing of it all.
