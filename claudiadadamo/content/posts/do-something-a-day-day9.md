I love this recipe - I made it for the first time last fall after I found it randomly online. It's so easy - there are only 3 ingredients:

* one can pumpkin
* one box spice cake mix
* one cup chocolate chips

Mix the pumpkin and spice cake mix together, then add chocolate chips. Scoop onto baking sheet.

I usually bake at 350 for about 12-15 minutes depending on the size of the cookies, and take them out when I push on them with a fork and there's resistance.

That's it!

After baking my first batch I had the awesome idea to take the rack out of my toaster oven, flip it over and use it as a cooling rack which worked really well.
