I don't have posts for the past two days - I've been really busy and don't have anything to really write about for those days. I think to fix this I'll write two extra blog posts at the end of my 30 days, so in total there will still be 30 posts, just over a little more than 30 days.

This Saturday I went to the Mini Maker Faire hosted by MIT. This event was awesome. I've never been to a maker faire before, so I was really excited that there was going to be one in the Boston area.

We started off walking by a table where they talked about the experiments they were doing forming chocolate into shapes with the equivalent of sand casting, but instead using brown sugar as the "sand" component.

We walked by other tables with electronics, art, music, robots, educational programs. This event was so up my alley. I love meeting people who are totally passionate about what they build!

We heard some guys talk about the work they do at Cambridge Hackspace, and they showed us their robot used for battling. So cool!

Then there was a self-made go cart race around a track, with people racing go carts that they built themselves. There was even a motorized shopping cart!

We were also able to go on a tour of the MIT IDC, which was incredible. We were able to check out some of the labs, including the Self-Assembly Lab. This lab is directed by Skylar Tibbits, and they work on [4D printing](http://video.mit.edu/watch/4d-printing-mit-self-folding-strand-13803/), which is something I've been interested in for a long time. We also got to see a really old 3D printer (I can't remember if it is the first, so I'm not going to say that it is, but I think it may be)

I came out of this event totally inspired to get back in the maker groove. I think working on these projects really helps me feel better and more like myself, and I'm really excited to keep building and teaching myself things. I'd really like to build something that is able to be displayed at a Maker Faire at some point.
