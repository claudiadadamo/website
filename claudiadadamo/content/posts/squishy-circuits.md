For the first assignment for [Maker Corps](http://makered.org/makercorps/)Â was to use Squishy Circuits to build something. I created a stop light (although it doesn't really look like one) that blinks green, red and yellow. I'm hoping that I can make the dough from the directions that they gave us so that I can make it look a lot more like a real traffic light. I used Play-Doh as the conductive dough, and hooked up an Arduino to control the LEDs.
