For this past week's project for Maker Corps, the ArtBot,Â I wanted to use glow-in-the-dark markers instead of regular markers just to see if it would be a cool result. I messed around with them for a while (I taped them to the inside of a box that I bought at the dollar store), and really liked what my artbot did. I'd flash light on the paper to charge the ink and see the patterns that it created. Then I thought that it would be cool to make the artbot charge it's own ink with light. I put some UV LED's underneath the box by the markers, and it was really cool seeing the ink right below it light up and stay lit for a bit! I just put it up on my youtube page if you'd like to see it in action - click the picture below to check it out
