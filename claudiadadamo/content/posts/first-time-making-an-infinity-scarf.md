title: First Time Making an Infinity Scarf!

Recently, I've been working on a lot of blankets. It's been a really easy way to remember how to crochet and knit. I've created a few granny square blankets and I just finished a simple knit blanket. Nothing too fancy. With all of those projects completed, I bought some really nice Baby Alpaca yarn and set off determined to make a circle scarf.

It took me a few tries to figure out how to get it to look the way I wanted. I just started with 18 stitches, and alternated knitting 3 and purling 3. Very simple! When I got to the length I thought was good, I cast off and then wove the remaining yarn between the two ends. Â I've been working on it in my downtime and just finished it today.

I really enjoyed this project. It was easy to work on, not that time consuming, and I'm so excited to wear what I've created! Too bad it's getting hot in New York City!
