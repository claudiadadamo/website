A bunch of my friends in the Computer Science department at Wheaton were accepted to present their poster on their iOS app they developed, called [cowDuck](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cowduck/id585482048?mt=8). I helped them make their poster for the conference.

It was mounted on a tri-fold board - here's what it looked like in person (even though it's a bad picture and cut off)
