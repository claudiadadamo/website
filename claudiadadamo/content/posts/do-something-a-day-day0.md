I returned from a 10 day trip to Europe two weeks ago, and the vacation really made me see things in a fresh perspective. Readjusting to being back at work was rough, especially when I felt like the determination that I came back to the US with was gone. 

So, I've decided to start a project. Actually, a bunch of projects. Inspired by ideas like Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180), I've decided to work on my own personal and professional development in a similar manner. For the next who knows how long-maybe I'll do 30 days and see how that goes-I am going to **do something every day** to rediscover what I'm passionate about and focus on my career development, and I will write a blog post each day about what I do. 

I will work on making, learning, reading, or doing one interesting, fun thing a day.
These could be things like:

- Learning to make loaves of bread from a new recipe
- Knitting/crocheting/needle felting
- Writing some code for some project (requires a bit more planning on my part, but this one can be spread out over time)
- Taking a glass blowing class
- Reading articles on an interesting topic, teaching myself about something new

That's what I have so far right now. I'm sure I'll come up with new ideas as I get going.

On days where I have events or cool activities planned, I'll go to them, and try to blog about them. The code section of this project will be important for the more "getting more experience and building a code portfolio" part of what I want to work on for myself, and there may be projects where one day isn't enough and I *need* to work on something the next day. If so, I'll just update with second day details of the project I'm working on.

Okay, so that's that. I figure if I put this online I'll hold myself more accountable for the things I do and writing the blog posts. And I'm excited to have some fun! 

For the next 30 days I'm going to do some interesting and creative stuff and I'll be updating my blog. There, I've said it. It's going to be done. Here goes!
