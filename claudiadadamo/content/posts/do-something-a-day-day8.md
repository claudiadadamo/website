Tonight some of my friends and I went to Fenway after work, and got to see the Yankees play the Sox. I've been to Fenway once before when I was in high school, but I've been living in Boston for a year and I have wanted to go to one as a local.

We ended up in a suite which was crazy! Free food and drinks, super fancy. We had a great time watching the game.
