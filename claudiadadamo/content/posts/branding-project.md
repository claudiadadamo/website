Our assignment was to create a fictional store in New York City, and to create all branding material for it. I created a Coffee House called Chatty Coffee (playing off of 'Chatty Kathy').

I created promotional material, postcards,Â cups/takeout boxes, shopping bag, buttons, business cards, and a table tent with information about my fictional coffee shop.
