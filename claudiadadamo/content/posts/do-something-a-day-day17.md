I still have so many apples! Today I baked a dozen apple oatmeal muffins. I found the recipe online, but switched a few things up based on what I had in my kitchen. 

The original recipe is here: [http://blommi.com/apple-oatmeal-muffins-recipe](http://blommi.com/apple-oatmeal-muffins-recipe/)

The changes I made:
I used skim milk instead of low fat buttermilk
I only used whole wheat spelt flour
I used 1 large Mutsu apple instead of a Granny Smith Apple, and I may have used too much but they're still delicious!

After making the substitutions and putting all of the ingredients together these came out really well. They're delicious and healthy and really easy to make!
